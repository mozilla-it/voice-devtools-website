        <p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">Alongside Mozilla’s Emerging Technologies team, we are driving transformational product and ecosystem development around the Voice market. Our goal is for  voice experiences to be private, open, and accessible to Everyone.<br/><br/>This work includes fostering the creation of a fully open set of foundational voice technologies, such as the open source Deep Speech speech-to-text Engine, our text-to-speech engine, and Common Voice, the world's largest database of open voice data.<br/><br/>Managed by the Open Innovation team, Common Voice is a globally crowdsourced project.</p>

        <p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">We believe that All Mozillians (paid staff and contributors) need to have convenient and appropriate access to Mozilla services through a unified, authoritative, integrated identity system that empowers them to build a better Internet. That is why we co-developed the Identity and Access Management program which aims to better integrate contributors into the Mozilla organization and workflows.</p>
