      <p class="c-section-links-text">Mozilla’s communities are wide-reaching and diverse, with over 14,000 global contributors in 2018 alone. The Open Innovation team works to understand how our communities discover and engage with Mozilla, how we can increase the impact of individual and commercial contributions, and how we can make their experiences are fantastic. Through research, tools and supporting infrastructure, we work across Mozilla to help teams connect with the expertise, creativity, capacity and influence of our contributor communities.</p>

        <p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">In 2017, the Open Innovation team ran the first set of qualitative and quantitative analyses of Mozilla’s contributor communities in order tounderstand how we might revitalize participation.<br/><br/>In 2019, we updated this report and made it fully public. From visualizing Mozilla’s numerous contributor communities in network graphs, analyzing social connectedness, and digging into regression bugs to stories from key Common Voice collaborators, this report has it all.</p>

        <p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">Mozilla recognizes we must change how we build and support our communities in order to unlock their full potential. This early report was our first broad look at diversity and inclusion across Mozilla’s contributor communities and was subsequently updated in our Mozilla and the Rebel Alliance reports.<br/><br/>Subsequently, we have built a number of protocols and systems that are practiced across Mozilla, increasing the inclusivity of our products and programs. In addition several of these systems are being adopted by external organizations, looking to increase D&I in their own workflows including Linux Foundation (CHAOSS), Red Hat (Fedora), Google (Kubernetes) and Public Lab.</p>

        <p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">While open source distribution is built into Mozilla’s identity and underpins our mission, we often need guidance around managing our numerous projects and relations with partner organizations, developers, and users. The Open Innovation team worked with Open Tech Strategies to develop a guide to choosing open source co-development models based on business needs. The report aimed to make it easier for Mozillians to talk productively about open source choices, goals, and tradeoffs -- and we hope it helps you too!</p>
